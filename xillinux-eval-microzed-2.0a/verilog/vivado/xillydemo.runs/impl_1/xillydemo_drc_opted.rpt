2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has direct IO Driver  
Clock net FRAME_VALID_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer. Driver(s): FRAME_VALID_IBUF_inst/O2000
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has direct IO Driver  
Clock net LINE_VALID_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer. Driver(s): LINE_VALID_IBUF_inst/O2000
Related violations: <none>

IOCS-1#1 Warning
IOB clock sharing  
IOs SPI_DAT, SPI_EN placed at Y17, Y16 connects to flops which are clocked by LUPA300/REG_CONFIG/n_0_g0_b0__0, LUPA300/REG_CONFIG/n_0_spi_en_reg_i_2.  Pushing these flops into IOB may cause PAR to fail because the clock route is shared between adjacent (differential pair) IOs.  If there are only two clocks packing them in different BELs might fix the problem, like INST IOB1_flop = BEL FF1 and INST IOB2_flop = BEL FF2.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	FRAME_VALID_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to P14
	FRAME_VALID_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

Related violations: <none>
